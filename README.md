# Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting whether the stock price of the S&P 500 index will go up or down based on historical data. The model is implemented using the RandomForestClassifier from the scikit-learn library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- yfinance
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install yfinance scikit-learn pandas matplotlib
```

### Code Structure

The project is organized into a single Jupyter notebook (`Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`). The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Retrieval and Exploration:** Fetching historical stock data using the `yfinance` library and exploring the dataset.

2. **Data Wrangling:** Preprocessing the data by removing unnecessary columns and creating a binary target variable based on the stock price movement.

3. **Initial Machine Learning Model:** Training a RandomForestClassifier using a basic set of predictors and evaluating its performance.

4. **Building a Backtesting System:** Implementing a backtesting system to assess the model's performance over time.

5. **Adding More Predictors:** Introducing additional predictors, such as rolling averages and trend indicators, to enhance the model's accuracy.

6. **Improving the Model:** Fine-tuning the RandomForestClassifier parameters and adjusting the prediction threshold for better results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook (`Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

3. Experiment with the code, modify parameters, or add new features to improve the model.
